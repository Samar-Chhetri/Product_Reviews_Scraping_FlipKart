386,The realme 11pro 5G device is very impressive with its outstanding performance with the integrated media tek chipset.A camera is a big thing the primary sensor is a 100MP sensor in the 11pro. The photos come out with quite good dynamic range and sharp photos.
387,After using it for 1 week this is the best smartphone Realme has launched. It supports 5G so well but camera is not up to mark.

891,"After about one month of usage, I can safely say, it's a good phone. Looks are nice and the build quality is sturdy too. The call quality is good over VOLTE, but only fair, if you call someone who is on 3g network. Camera quality is good for casual shots, and I didn't expect anything better. I clicked couple of pictures in daylight and that was my impressions. Your's may be better.Battery management is not that great, mind you, I am not a heavy user. It could have been better for a 5000ma..."
